# Lab | Tableau+SQL

## Introduction

In this lab, we will practice in Tableau creating the connection with MySQL database. Please note, we will use the database Employee, introduced in the previous labs.



## Getting Started

To complete this lab, follow each of the steps below:
1. Please try both methods a) Connect the data sourse (data base) b) use table in csv (save as csv the results of the query). Please see the video below for the clarifications
2. Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 
3. Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
4. Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.
5. Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure. Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart. 
6. Create the dashboard that consists of these four visualizations
