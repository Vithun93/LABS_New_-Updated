# Lab | Probability Distributions


## Introduction

As a data anaylist, you might need to use probability distribution for several reasons: 
- To analyze data to find useful patterns.
- To make better data-driven decisions by anwering questions like 'how likely it is that an observation of a random variable occurs'.
