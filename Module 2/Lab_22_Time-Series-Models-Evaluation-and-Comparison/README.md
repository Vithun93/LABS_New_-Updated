## Introduction

In this lab, we will implement end-to-end process of the model selection and new value prediction for time series

## Getting Started
The task is to predict the price of Bitcoin for the next 5 periods:
 - get the data (from Yahoo Finance, BTC-USD). We are interested in all available data, Close price, daily
 - analyze the time series. Do we have stationary data? What about autocorrelation?
 - Implement AR and MA models.
 - Please use AIC, BIC and error-based metrics for the estimations
 - What are the models with the best performance?
 - Create the function that allows to implement ARMA model, evaluate the result and choose one model with the best performance.
 - Create the function that allows to implement ARIMA model, evaluate the result and choose one model with the best performance.
 - Make the forecast for the 5 periods
 - Make the conclusion
 - Make business conclusion answering the question, if I should buy Bitcoins

## Deliverables
