## Introduction

This project aims to practice in descriptive and prescriptive statistics  and dashboards creation with Tableau.




## Project Goal

- Troubles forecast
* Develop the idea of your dashboard:
 - what exactly you want to show?

 - which widgets represent the most powerful insights?
* Your dashboard should give the possibility to filter the data
* Please note, that you need to have at least 12 widgets that describe your data.
* Please note, you have at least 2 widgets that should reflect forecasted values.
